## MY APPROACH TOWARDS THE TASK

This task was one of the most exciting ones. I started with the basic manifest.json file. I then proceeded with the html and css files and linked them both together along with a javascript file. First, I designed the basic structure using the <div> element and defined each of them using classes. I then gave the textbox to take input which would display the weather of that speicifc place in the background. 

My next task was to call the api and fetch data from the api. I then first selected and downloaded the images which I planned to use in the background according to the weather. I then generated the greeting message which would enhance the extension further. I finally added the event listener for the search button. I capped off the task by adding some styling to the css file.

This task was very enjoyable throughout and I loved the task so much. I found the task of moderate level and enjoyed working on it, especially the styling process and all. Overall, it was a good learning experience which made me learn in deep about extensions.

## OVERALL EXPERIENCE

I found this task quite easy, mainly because the process was very clean and was without much confusion. I just seemed to go on with the flow. I got to know many new things, for me especially, who doesnt even know what an extension is, this task was very helpful and I thoroughly enjoyed each and every part.
