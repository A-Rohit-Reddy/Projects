## MY APPROACH TOWARDS THIS TASK

## PART-1

After cloning the repository, I had to first install the live server extension in order to reflect the changes on the website directly without the need to reload the site everytime. This part was easy to do since all we had to do was to link the js and css files to the html file.

## PART-2

This part needed us to add sound functionality to our website. This part seemed a bit difficult compared to the first part since I had to code in javascript. so I had to learn the basics of setting up an onClick Event Listener. This part made this task very exciting.

## PART-3

All this task required us to do was some styling and I enjoyed the process thoroughly. It also helped me learn how to style a website in an effective way.

## PART-4

The last part was easy as it required adding fonts in which I already had experience. After completion of the task, I felt very satisfied and gave it to my little sister for her to play, which further excited me.

## OVERALL EXPERIENCE

I enjoyed every part of this task and found it the easiest among the lot. I have learnt new things and further enhanced my web skills. I was happy on completing the task and was happy by the way everything panned out.
